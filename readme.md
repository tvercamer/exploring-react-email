## Installing the project
Installing react-emails is actually quite easy, you can just follow along with the explanation in the [docs](https://react.email/docs/getting-started/manual-setup). There is however something that I personally did not like, which is the need to install every component individually. Personally, I would have preferred to install all of them and just import the ones I need.

## Running the project
Once you have created an email, you can use the command ```yarn dev``` which will create an entire Next project in a folder called ```.react-email```. I would suggest to gitignore this entire folder. However, it does take some time before the compiler has finished.
